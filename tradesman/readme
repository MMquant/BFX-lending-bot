Please Read First. Hello everyone, I'm Volkan and studying Engineering
management master program in M.E.T.U., this is a research for one of my
projects. This submit is inspired by
http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/44890-btc-e-trade-api
very nice example to show how matlab can handle this situation. Please
check his submit too and find some answers regarding certificate errors. 
I've tried to hide error definitions inside the functions to simplify 
examples script so please type one of the below functions to see the error
definition. All servers are fully operational without authentication and
BTC-E, Bitfinex and CEX.IO is operational with authentication. Before
starting with authentication operations please try all non authenticated
examples and be sure all working. If any problems regarding non
authenticated connections, please check your SSL certificate as mentioned
above. Cex.io requires username for authentication, case sensitive, no
need for username for the rest. Crypto.m is from doHMAC_SHA512.m function
only changed its behaviour to operate for all types, submited by "wout" also.
urlread2 and http_createHeader functions are "Jim Hokanson" 's work. I
deeply appreciate these guys work they are awesome. I will try
to update rest and maybe add more servers to the list. Please enjoy. If
you have any requests please contact me by email e134855@metu.edu.tr .
